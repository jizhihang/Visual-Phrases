Current Issue : 
Subject Exists but has multiple actors on it. 

Line 90 of test2 was the fix for subject does not exist..
________________
New Method, Using Bounding Boxes:

still go through all tags..
for tags that split > 1, 
	find number of instances of phrase
	
	find number of instances of subject + number of instances of object
	find number of possible locations

	If number of possible locations != numInst of phrase
		test if bbox of subject + object is within bbox of phrase.
		if so, use that feature.
	else set to a 0 feature.

	had to make assumption that subject will always exist.. since bounding box
may not always match up.

Error Cases:
1. [subject + phrase] data point(s), no subject data point(s).
[person_jumping] [person]? - same box as person

2. [subject + phrase + object] ... [subject] ... [object] , missing subject + object for a sample.
person_riding_horse  -- ignore phrase without both subject + object.  

3. [subject + phrase + object] [object] , missing subject.
ignore , manually change label if few cases.
