Current Issue : 
Subject Exists but has multiple actors on it. 

Line 90 of test2 was the fix for subject does not exist..
________________
New Method, Using Bounding Boxes:

still go through all tags..
for tags that split > 1, 
	find number of instances of phrase
	
	find number of instances of subject + number of instances of object
	find number of possible locations

	If number of possible locations != numInst of phrase
		test if bbox of subject + object is within bbox of phrase.
		if so, use that feature.
	else set to a 0 feature.

	had to make assumption that subject will always exist.. since bounding box
may not always match up.
